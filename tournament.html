      <h2>Full Tournament Rules</h2>
      <h1>Welcome to The Madness of Billiards</h1>
    <p>Today, I want to invite you to participate in our first tournament with exceptional prizes, ranging from a $300 USD Amazon gift card to a $1,600 USD Apple gift card.</p>

    <h2>Here are the rules:</h2>
    <p>In multiplayer ranking mode, every match you win or lose will affect your points and determine your position in the global ranking.</p>
    <p>In each match, you must bring three minions. Each minion has unique abilities, and finding the perfect combination will be key to your victory. Additionally, select a Cue that gives you an advantage with each shot and an Avatar that represents you.</p>

    <h3>Once in the match, there are four ways to win:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pocket all your assigned balls, leaving the 8-ball for last.</li>
        <li>Wait for your opponent to pocket the 8-ball prematurely.</li>
        <li>And the most strategic! Protect your heart's health. On each turn, you'll see stones blocking the pockets, and from each pocket, a minion of your opponent will emerge to attack your heart. If your heart's health reaches 0, you’ll lose the match!</li>
        <li>If your opponent surrenders or abandons the match.</li>
    </ol>
